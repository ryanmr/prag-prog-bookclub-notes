# Chapter 1

### Forward, Preface

It's been 20 years since the original edition of this book was written and printed. Can you imagine what changes in 20 years and what does not? There is timely advice and practically timeless advise, but neither are exclusive to technology centric topics or the human condition of building.

---

Of the five characteristics of a _pragmatic programmer_, which do you identify strongly with? Which of these characteristics do you try to share with others to help them grow?

### Itâ€™s Your Life

> Tip 3: You have agency

Is this _agency_ unique from other kinds of work? With this kind of agency, what do we expect from others? Is that fair?

---

Think about Martin Fowler's quote, and think about what it means.

> You can change your organization or you can change your organization.



### The Cat Ate My Source Code

> Trust in a team us absolutely essential for creativity and collaboration...

How do you foster this kind of environment and trust?

### Software Entropy

> Tip 5: Don't live with broken windows

We engage with a lot of "broken windows" by the nature of our work. Where should that line be drawn? Regulation _is_ not bad, but it does raise the acceptance criteria, and have residual effects. What might those be?

### Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs

> Tip 6: Be a catalyst for change

Recall _agency_, and think about how this is related. While we work in _the code_, we are often in a unique position to see a slice of a _system_ too (whether that be for ag-value, or medical value, or retail value, etc).

Likewise, recall _changing your organization_, how does this relate?

---

> Tip 7: Remember the big picture

Despite having a vertical slice of a _system_, we are experts only in a tiny portion of the system, and it is almost always the most inconsequential part. How do you reconcile this?

### Good-Enough Software

> Tip 8: Make quality a requirements issue

Different users have different preconceived notions of "doneness" and "correctness". In your experience using applications and services, what things a while ago that were new then are almost in the realm of functional requirements now? (what used to be explicitly asked for, now is implicitly assumed?)

--- 

Knowing when to stop working on something, either by way of users no longer _getting value_ or from your own personal brick wall, is important. Do you find letting code sit for a while helps? Letting others read it? Letting someone try it?

### Your Knowledge Portfolio

In the *Building Your Portfolio* section, there are five aspects of managing your _knowledge portfolio_. Of those five, which are your strongest and weakest? Which of those do you think will flip from strong-to-weak or weak-to-strong later in your career? What traps can you imagine relative to any of these steps? 

Following that, there is a list of _goals_ to help you "acquire intellectual capital". Which are the most realistic for you today? What do you do now?

---

> Tip 10: Critically analyze what you read and hear

This is not restricted to engineering or programming, this is a basic life skill.

### Communicate!

At the end of this section, the summary provides a summary as an unordered list. Could you imagine this list ordered though? What should be added here? Technical accuracy and precision?

---

When communicating, when it is OK and maybe even _important_ to hedge?

Kevin Rose, large tech-company founder and nowadays venture capitalist, [uses the _three sentence_ email structure](http://kevinrose.squarespace.com/blogg/2010/8/17/email-sucks-5-time-saving-tips.html). Do you think something like that is enough for the majority of your formal communications?
